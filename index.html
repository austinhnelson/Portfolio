                <h4>WHOAMI?</h4>
                <p>
                    Born and raised amidst the sunny vibes of Southern California, I embarked on an exciting journey
                    that led me to the vibrant city of Boise, Idaho, where I pursued my passion for computer science at
                    Boise State University. As I stand on the cusp of my final semester of undergraduate studies, I'm
                    fueled by a burning ambition to dive headfirst into the world of software development upon
                    graduation.
                    <br><br>
                    While I've dabbled in the realms of Cybersecurity and database management, I crave the opportunity
                    to immerse myself in the dynamic landscape of real-world software development. The allure of
                    crafting innovative solutions and shaping the digital future has always been my driving force.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond the code and algorithms, you'll find a spirited adventurer in me. I thrive on outdoor
                    escapades, whether it's conquering challenging trails, sprinting through the wilderness, or soaking
                    in the beauty of nature. My enthusiasm extends to indoor battles as well â€“ I'm a devoted gym-goer
                    and a fierce chess player during my downtime.
                    <br><br>
                    Post-graduation, my compass points to the unknown. I'm ready and excited to embrace new horizons,
                    considering relocation and travel as opportunities to grow both professionally and personally. Let's
                    embark on this journey together and explore the endless possibilities that the world of software
                    development has to offer.

                <h4>C PROGRAMMING TUTOR</h4>
                <p>
                    As a dedicated tutor for CS 253 (Programming in C), I provided assistance to students
                    enrolled in the course. My role involved offering guidance and support in comprehending challenging
                    concepts and completing assignments effectively. By leveraging my expertise in C programming, I
                    facilitated a deeper understanding of the subject matter, ensuring that students gained the
                    confidence and skills necessary to excel in their coursework. My commitment to fostering a positive
                    learning environment and my ability to explain complex topics in a clear and approachable manner
                    were key factors in aiding student success.

                <h4>CYBERDOME ENGINEER</h4>
                <p>
                    As a Tier 1 Engineer at the Institute of Pervasive Cybersecurity, I played a key role in developing
                    and maintaining a dynamic lab
                    simulation. This platform allowed Red Team attackers and Blue Team defenders to test their
                    strategies against a vulnerable corporate server environment. My responsibilities included setup,
                    maintenance, and ensuring the operational integrity of this critical training ground. This hands-on
                    experience contributed to the advancement of cybersecurity strategies in a real-world context. I
                    gained real world experience with working with various network tools, computer network principles
                    and Linux operating systems.
